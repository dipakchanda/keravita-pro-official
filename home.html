						<h3>Suffering from toenail fungus?</h3>
					</div>

					<p class="mb-0">
						A toenail infection is an infection of the nail or sometimes the tissues around it. In the US alone, this infection is spreading fast, as 20% of the
						population suffers from it, and 70% of the elderly who are over 60 are affected by it. It often causes pain and itches as the infection grows. The nail
						gets yellowish and thick. And if the infection is kept unchecked, then it can cause the nail to be brittle and sometimes detached from the nail bed too.
						This can affect our day-to-day activities too, and even things like wearing shoes can be harder. Furthermore, the infection can spread internally too, which
						has hardardous effects. There can be multiple types of fungus that affect nails, as these fungi grow mainly in warm and moist environments.

						<h3>Keravita Pro Ingredients</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<div class="row">


							<p>
								<p>
									Keravita Pro consists of more than 25 all-natural ingredients, all working together for the same result. Here are the main stars of the formula.
								</p>
							</p>

						</div>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>Beta-Glucan - </b> Beta-glucan is a type of soluble fiber that has been linked to improved cholesterol levels and a healthy heart. Another
									way that beta-glucan is expected to work is by boosting the immune system so that the body can overcome any particular infection. 
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>ARA-6 - </b>ARA-6 is yet another fiber-rich ingredient that is referred to as larch arabinogalactan.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>Japanese Mushroom Complex - </b>When mixed with Beta-Glucan, this ingredient fights all types of fungal infections and removes any remains of
									the same from your bloodstream.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>Curcumin - </b>Curcumin is a bioactive compound found in turmeric. It carries antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antifungal
									properties. As an antifungal, this ingredient has been found to prevent fungus growth and spread.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>Cat’s Claw - </b>The name “cat’s claw” was given to a woody vine called uncaria tomentosa because its thorns resemble cat’s claws. As for its
									properties, one particular source claims they include antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral effects.
									Garlic: Garlic appears to have made the cut because it is high in allicin. In regard to its usefulness, it is suggested that the ingestion of
									allicin can help to protect one from candida spread and growth.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>Lycopene & Pomegranate - </b>Lycopene is a type of plant nutrient that carries vital antioxidant properties. It is what gives many of our
									fruits and vegetables its bright red color. Aside from antioxidants, lycopene is trusted to carry antibacterial and antifungal properties.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>Quercetin, Green Tea and Ginseng - </b>Like lycopene, quercetin is a plant pigment high in antioxidant properties. Quercetin, green tea, and
									ginseng are some examples of flavonoid sources. The reason for this rests in the ingredients’ ability to prevent fungal growth by disrupting the
									plasma membrane, all while preventing cell wall formation, cell division, etc.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>Olive Leaf Extract - </b>As the name suggests, olive leaf extract comes from the leaves of an olive plant.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>Selenium, Graviola and Pine Bark (the defense trio) - </b>Richard calls the likes of selenium (an essential mineral that aims to eliminate
									oxidative stress), graviola (a tree that has been linked to treating infections) and pine bark (contains bioflavonoids with anti-inflammatory
									and antioxidant properties) as the “anti-fungal defense trio” all of which aim to unmask fungus toxin in the body.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<b>Red Raspberry, Vitamin C and Vitamin E - </b>Finally comes yet another trio which together has been advertised as “joining forces to shield
									your lungs from the constant attack of fungal bacteria that is being inhaled on a daily basis, acting as a potent internal antifungal filter.”
								</p>
